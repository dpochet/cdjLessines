2020-02-17: Start development of tool to create scratchblocks from a scratch.mit.edu -hosted Scratch! project
            This is an attempt to replace "Generate" function of GitHub scratchblocks for v3.0 projects
            (generate from http://scratchblocks.github.io/#?style=scratch3&script= does not work / deprecated)
            To load HTML page that drives conversion, go to:
            http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/dpochet/cdjLessines/blob/master/Test.htm
            From that page, just type Scratch! v3.0 project nr to be converted in scratchblocks, and click "Get project data".
