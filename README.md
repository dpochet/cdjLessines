2020-02-17: Start development of tool to create scratchblocks from a scratch.mit.edu -hosted Scratch! project
            This is an attempt to replace "Generate" function of GitHub scratchblocks for v3.0 projects
            (generate from http://scratchblocks.github.io/#?style=scratch3&script= does not work / deprecated)
